# Stock Market Kafka Real Time Data Engineering Project

## Introduction 
This project focuses on executing an End-To-End Data Engineering Project revolving around Real-Time Stock Market Data utilizing Kafka. Through a combination of Python programming and various Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools such as S3, Athena, Glue, and EC2, alongside Apache Kafka, the aim is to facilitate seamless data processing and analysis.

## Architecture

 This illustration outlines the flow of data from its real-time source through various processing stages and finally to the storage and analysis components.

## Technology Used
- Programming Language - Python
- Amazon Web Service (AWS)
1. S3 (Simple Storage Service):For storing data at scale reliably and cost-effectively.
2. Athena: An interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.
3. Glue Crawler: Automatically discovers the schema of your data and stores the associated metadata in the Glue Data Catalog.
4. Glue Catalog: Acts as a central repository to store metadata about data sources, transformations, and targets.
5. EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud instances can be used for running applications on the AWS cloud.
- Apache Kafka: A distributed streaming platform that enables the building of real-time streaming data pipelines and applications.

### This amalgamation of tools and technologies ensures efficient data ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis, ultimately facilitating insights generation from real-time stock market data.
